# Readme

This is a python project that I tried to turn into a javascript project.

There's a readme for the js portion too in js/facility.

It's basically a facility location problem but with minimax, or maximin.

So you see there are customers and facilities, and you want the same number of customers on each side of the facility, basically. One way to do that is with this optimization.

To simplify things, there is one facility and one customer at each pixel. Customers have preferences for facilities. The preferences are simply an ordering of facilities. No amount of distance is used. But still, we can get an idea of how far customers are from facilities.

I'm not really explaining everything, so you're probably wondering what this means.

The point of this project is to get closer to an explanation of it. I wrote this readme last, though, so it's not great.
